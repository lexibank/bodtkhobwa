This dataset was prepared from a collection of original field work data by TTimotheus A. Bodt, during an intensive week of collaboration with Johann-Matttis List and the [CALC](http://calc.digling.org) project in July 2018. The data comprises 8 varieties of Kho-Bwa in phonetic transcription and with explicit segmentation of morphemes.
